# pandas-practice_1
Personal practice while learning Pandas for Data Analysis

#Codes Used
- Creation of new column
- Implementation of apply() with a function (ie. lambda x)
  Lambda is a keyword used to create a short, anoymous function - a function without a name.
  AKA "lambda x" is mainly used for a one time use function, particularly when additional logic condition is required.
- Condtional column creation (also with lambda x if else)
- Implementation of .map()

#Why I made this
Similarly to my first repo, this tracks my journey in building basic Pandas foundations in data analysis.
Goals completed thus far-
  . Basic Python
  . Basic Numpy
